	The ordered regression analysis is conducted on the provided wine quality dataset, wherein the attributes of the dataset are thoroughly examined. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation is performed to assess the performance of different algorithms on both the regenerated dataset using Smote algorithm and the original dataset without Smote algorithm. Finally, the results obtained from the ordered regression analysis are derived.
