\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}


%\todo{Narrow down to a topic; Dig a hole; Fill the hole}
\todo{Formula for Introduction}



%\gangli{``narrow in on topic'' reminds you 
%that readers and reviewers only know that this is a AI or HTM research paper (and maybe have read the title/abstract). 
%You need to help them figure out what topic and area of research paper this is. 
%You _don't_ need to wax poetic about the topic's importance.}

%\gangli{`dig a hole'' reminds you that 
%you need to convince the reader that there's a problem with the state of the world. 
%Prior work may exist but it's either missing something important or there's a missing opportunity. 
%The reader should be drooling for a bright future just out of reach.}

%\gangli{``fill the hole'' reminds you to show the reader 
%how and why the paper they're reading will fix these problems and deliver us into a better place. 
%You don't need a whirlwind summary of the technical details, 
%but you need readers convinced (and in a good mood) to keep reading.}

\gangli{A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. 
If you follow a simple set of rules, 
you can write a very good introduction. 
The following outline can be varied. 
For example, 
you can use two paragraphs instead of one, 
or you can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. 
But in all cases, 
all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, 
and in most papers, 
you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.}



%\todo{The importance of the area}
%\blindtext
\todo{Motivation}
At a high level, 
what is the problem area you are working in and why is it important? 
It is important to set the larger context here. 
Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?


%\todo{The problems faced by most current methods}
%\blindtext
\todo{What is the specific problem considered in this paper?}
This paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. 
In the first paragraph you have established general context and importance. 
Here you establish specific context and background.

%\todo{What can be addressed by existing methods; Why those problems are challenges to existing methods?}
%\blindtext
\todo{Contribution}
"In this paper, we show that ...". 
This is the key paragraph in the intro - you summarize, 
in one paragraph, 
what are the main contributions of your paper given the context 
you have established in paragraphs 1 and 2. 
What is the general approach taken? 
Why are the specific results significant? 
This paragraph must be really good. 

You should think about how to structure these one or 
two paragraph summaries of what your paper is all about. 
If there are two or three main results, 
then you might consider itemizing them with bullets or in test. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g., First ...
	\item e.g., Second ...
	\item e.g., Third ...
\end{itemize}
If the results fall broadly into two categories, 
you can bring out that distinction here. 
For example, "Our results are both theoretical and applied in nature. 
(two sentences follow, one each on theory and application)"

%\todo{What provides the motivation of this work? What are the research issues? What is the rationale of this work? }
%\blindtext
\todo{At a high level what are the differences in what you are doing, and what others have done? }
Keep this at a high level, 
you can refer to a future section where specific details and differences will be given. 
But it is important for the reader to know at a high level, 
what is new about this work compared to other work in the area.

%\todo{What we have done and what are the contributions.}
%\blindtext
\todo{A roadmap for the rest of the paper}
"The remainder of this paper is structured as follows..." 
Give the reader a roadmap for the rest of the paper. 
Avoid redundant phrasing, 
"In Section 2, In section 3, ... In Section 4, ... " etc.

\gangli{A few general tips:
Don't spend a lot of time into the introduction 
telling the reader about what you don't do in the paper. 
Be clear about what you do do.
Does each paragraph have a theme sentence that sets the stage for the entire paragraph? Are the sentences and topics in the paragraph all related to each other?}

\gangli{Does each paragraph have a theme 
sentence that sets the stage for the entire paragraph? 
Are the sentences and topics in the paragraph all related to each other?}

\gangli{Do all of your tenses match up in a paragraph?}
