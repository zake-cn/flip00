  abstract = {In-network caching has been widely adopted in Content Centric Networking (CCN) to accelerate data delivery, mitigate server load and reduce network traffic. However, the line-speed requirement makes the in-network caching space very limited. With the rapid growth of network traffic, it is significant challenging to decide content placement in such limited cache space. To conquer this conflict, coordinated in-network caching schemes are needed so as to maximize the profit of ubiquitous caching capacities. In particular, in-network caching in CCN is deployed as an arbitrary network topology and naturally supports dynamic request routing. Therefore, content placement scheme and dynamic request routing are tightly coupled and should be addressed together. In this paper, we propose a coordinated in-network caching model to decide the optimal content placement and the shortest request routing path under constraints of cache space and link bandwidth in a systematic fashion. Via extensive simulations, the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model has been validated.},

  year     = {2016},
  pages    = {1-24},
  abstract = {A preference relation-based Top-N recommendation approach is proposed to capture both second-order and higher-order interactions among users and items. Traditionally Top-N recommendation was achieved by predicting the item ratings first, and then inferring the item rankings, based on the assumption of availability of explicit feedback such as ratings, and the assumption that optimizing the ratings is equivalent to optimizing the item rankings. Nevertheless, both assumptions are not always true in real world applications. The proposed approach drops these assumptions by exploiting preference relations, a more practical user feedback. Furthermore, the proposed approach enjoys the representational power of Markov Random Fields thus side information such as item and user attributes can be easily incorporated. Comparing to related work, the proposed approach has the unique property of modeling both second-order and higher-order interactions among users and items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time both types of interactions have been captured in preference-relation based methods. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that both types of interactions have been properly captured, and significantly improved Top-N recommendation performance has been achieved.},

We introduce a new method of measuring the contribution of researchers to the connectivity of collaboration networks and evaluate the importance of researchers by considering both contribution and productivity. Betweenness centrality is found to be better than degree centrality in terms of reflecting the changes of importance of researchers. Accordingly, a method is further proposed to identify key researchers at certain periods. The performance of the identified researchers demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Service oriented architecture has been proposed to support collaborations among distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) applications in an open dynamic environment. However, WSNs are resource constraint, and have limited computation abilities, limited communication bandwidth and especially limited energy. Fortunately, sensor nodes in WSNs are usually deployed redundantly, which brings the opportunity to adopt a sleep schedule for balanced energy consumption to extend the network lifetime. Due to miniaturization and energy efficiency, one sensor node can integrate several sense units and support a variety of services. Traditional sleep schedule considers only the constraints from the sensor nodes, can be categorized to a one-layer (i.e., node layer) issue. The service oriented WSNs should resolve the energy optimization issue considering the two-layer constraints, i.e., the sensor nodes layer and service layer. Then, the one-layer energy optimization scheme in previous work is not applicable for service oriented WSNs. Hence, in this paper we propose a sleep schedule with a service coverage guarantee in WSNs. Firstly, by considering the redundancy degree on both the service level and the node level, we can get an accurate redundancy degree of one sensor node. Then, we can adopt fuzzy logic to integrate the redundancy degree, reliability and energy to get a sleep factor. Based on the sleep factor, we furthermore propose the sleep mechanism. The case study and simulation evaluations illustrate the capability of our proposed approach.},

The proposed sorting method is competitive to the state-of-the-art GPU sorting algorithms and is superior to most ofthem for long sorting keys.},

The challenges are primarily due to the inefficient data collection approaches currently in use. In this paper, we present a new approach to this task by exploiting the socially generated and user-contributed geotagged photos now made publicly available on the Internet. Our case study focuses on HongKong inbound tourism using 29,443 photos collected from 2100 tourists. We demonstrate how a dataset constructed from such geotagged photos can help address such challenges as well as provide useful practical implications for destination development, transportation planning, and impact management. This study has the potential to benefit tourism researchers worldwide from better understanding travel behavior and developing sustainable tourism industries.},

  abstract = {Hotel managers continue to find ways to understand traveler preferences, with the aim of improving their strategic planning, marketing, and product development. Traveler preference is unpredictable; for example, hotel guests used to prefer having a telephone in the room, but now favor fast Internet connection. Changes in preference influence the performance of hotel businesses, thus creating the need to identify and address the demands of their guests. Most existing studies focus on current demand attributes and not on emerging ones. Thus, hotel managers may find it difficult to make appropriate decisions in response to changes in travelers' concerns. To address these challenges, this paper adopts Emerging Pattern Mining technique to identify emergent hotel features of interest to international travelers. Data are derived from 118,000 records of online reviews. The methods and findings can help hotel managers gain insights into travelers' interests, enabling the former to gain a better understanding of the rapid changes in tourist preferences.},

  abstract = {Privacy preserving on data mining and data release has attracted an increasing research interest over a number of decades. Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.},

  abstract = {Differential privacy is an essential and prevalent privacy model that has been widely explored in recent decades. This survey provides acomprehensive and structured overview of two research directions: differentially private data publishing and differentially private data analysis. We compare the diverse release mechanisms of differentially private data publishing given a variety of input data in terms of query type, the maximum number of queries, efficiency, and accuracy. We identify two basic frameworks for differentially private data analysis and list the typical algorithms used within each framework. The results are compared and discussed based on output accuracy and efficiency. Further, we propose several possible directions for future research and possible applications.},

  title    = {Answering Differentially Private Queries for Continual Datasets Release},
  journal  = {Future Generation Computer Systems},
  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {Privacy preserving data release is a hot topic that attracts a lot of attentions in data mining, machine learning, and social network communities. Most studies on privacy preserving focus on static data releases; however, data are usually updated periodically. As a potential solution, differential privacy addresses continual data release by simplifying it into an event stream release problem. This approach overlooks the relationshipbetween events, which is defined as coupled information in this paper. We argue that datasets cannot be simplified as an event stream due to the coupled information. In addition, the coupled information may reveal more private information than expected. This work proposes a privacy-preserving mechanism that explicitly identify the coupled information in continually released datasets. In stead of simplifying datasets to event streams, this mechanism considers the continual released datasets as coupled datasets based on the relationship between the same individual in different datasets, and the relationship between different individuals in the same dataset. We also propose the notion of coupled sensitivity for answering differentially privatequeries and develop an iterative based coupled continual release algorithm, called CCR, that answers these queries with a large set of differentially private results. Theoretical analysis proves the privacy of this method, and an extensive performance study shows that CCR outperforms traditional differential privacy mechanisms when answering a large set of queries.},

  year     = {2016},
  abstract = {Learning from imbalanced data is a challenging task in a wide range of applications, which attracts significant research efforts from machine learning and data mining community. As a natural approach to this issue, oversampling balances the training samples through replicating existingsamples or synthesizing new samples. In general, synthesization outperforms replication by supplying additional information on the minority class. However, the additional information needs to follow the same normal distribution of the training set, which further constrains the new samples within thepredefined range of training set. In this paper, we present the Wiener process oversampling (WPO) technique that brings the physics phenomena into sample synthesization. WPO constructs a robust decision region by expanding the attribute ranges in training set while keeping the same normal distribution. The satisfactory performance of WPO can be achieved with much lower computing complexity. In addition, by integrating WPO with ensemble learning, the WPOBoost algorithm outperformsmany prevalent imbalance learning solutions.},
